# Colmar-Academy

Capstone Project: Colmar Academy

1. As suggested, I designed a favicon for the project. But, I took this one step further, designing a new logo as well. In my real-life web development experience, I have done this for several clients and companies. 

For the fictitious Colmar Academy, I took into consideration color scheme and typography, and I incorporated a fictitious mascot for the school’s sports team called the ‘Trailblazers.’ The fictitious re-design committee, associated with Colmar Academy, also wanted to maintain the white, grey, and black school colors, adding only one more, maroon. Altogether, the committee wanted to reflect its outstanding reputation for developing students with strong leadership skills since they will become the ‘trailblazers’ of the future. 

Please note that I actually did not design this logo, per se, but rather I found an image online with a transparent background, a mascot, and the correct corresponding colors. It was suitable, though not ideal, for the task. Anyway, at the time of this writing, this is the only rendition of this project with a new logo that I have seen. I hope this decision is acceptable.

2. I also took the liberty of updating the copyright to 2017. I would insist upon this for my clients in real life.

3. In addition, I corrected the grammar and the punctuation of the content. I even included text that I thought would be suited for Colmar Academy.

4. I added the Social Media icons which is essential for almost every business in this day and age.

5. On a more technical basis, I utilized transitions, hover, and autoplay for the video. For those who would need a screen reader, I included some roles, properties, and semantic elements for ARIA.

6. I’m still having some trouble with the mobile code, not being able to get all of the elements to properly display or not for some of the widths. I don’t know if this has to do with the need to ‘force upload’ to GitHub recently, overwriting what I had uploaded previously (Thursday, June 8th; see Commits tab). In any case, when I made additional changes to the CSS afterward, in several attempts to fix what was not perfect for all of the screen views, they just made things worse. I tried; sorry it’s not perfect. In real life I would have contacted a consultant, if necessary, to make it perfect. 

In moving forward, I will keep learning to improve my web development skills.

Happy Reviewing!
